              Southwest Gas is offering Distributed Generation rebates to eligible commercial and 
              industrial Arizona customers for qualifying combined heat and power (CHP) systems. 
              Long-term energy savings can be realized throughout the life of the CHP equipment. 
              The program provides customers an opportunity to increase the energy efficiency and 
              lower energy costs of their businesses. Most CHP systems are configured to generate 
              electricity or mechanical power, recapture the waste heat and use it for space heating, 
              water heating, industrial steam loads, air conditioning, humidity control, water cooling, 
              product drying or any other thermal need.

              Eligible high-efficiency CHP generation systems produce localized, on-site power and heat 
              from natural gas. They can vary in size from several kilowatts (kWs) to several 
              megawatts (MWs) of produced electric power, and can be used in a variety of commercial, 
              industrial and institutional applications.

              Eligible CHP systems must achieve a total system efficiency of 60% to 70% or higher. 
              This efficiency must be demonstrated during standard operations that will vary according 
              to the type of facility where CHP is utilized. Incentive awards include the following 
              levels up to a maximum of 50% of the installed cost of any project:
